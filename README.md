# ATM
Simulate an ATM (automatic teller machine) that handles checking
and savings accounts.

The ATM is used by the customers of a bank. 
1) Each customer has two accounts: a checking account and a savings account. 
2) Each customer also has a customer number and a personal identification number (PIN);
both are required to gain access to the accounts. With the ATM, customers can
select an account (checking or savings). The balance of the selected account is displayed. Then
the customer can deposit and withdraw money. This process is repeated until the customer
chooses to exit.
